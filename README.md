# odin-books

This project is a part of the Odin fullstack Javascript curriculum.

The intent of this project is to create a small Library app to learn about Objects.

Learnt:

- Using constructor functions to create objects
- Add functions within objects
- Work with array of Objects
- Toggle html elements via their display property
- Use inputs and events to alter state
- See some similarities in functions and replace with a general function
- Rerender table body (naive)

Roadmap:

[] Add input validation
[] Add styling for page
[] Add overlay for modal
[] Find a better way to rerender on state change
